# MedMemo

## üìå Project Overview

MedMemo is a web application designed to help patients keep structured and informative notes from their healthcare provider visits. By simply copying and pasting a transcript of their visit dialogue, users can generate a well-organized summary that includes key medical information, personal questions, and additional context that is often missing from traditional healthcare records.

Powered by a **deep learning model** and a **large language model (LLM)**, MedMemo transforms unstructured conversation transcripts into clear, actionable medical notes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Upload Document**: Upload PNG or PDF files, which are scanned using OCR to extract text and link the content to your personal account for further processing.
- **Transcript Summarization**: Upload medical visit documents to receive structured, AI-generated summaries highlighting diagnoses, treatments, and key insights.
- **Suggested Articles**: Automatically receive links to trusted health articles relevant to the medical terms and topics found in your transcript summary.
- **Chatbot Assistant**: Ask follow-up questions or clarify medical terms using an AI-powered chatbot that references your summaries and general health knowledge.
- **Download/Export**: Save your medical summaries and documents as text files for offline access, printing, or sharing.
- **View History**: Access a chronological view of all your previously uploaded documents and generated summaries, organized by date.
- **Prescription Reminder**: Connect to your Google Calendar to schedule reminders for medications, including dosage, frequency, and start/end dates.
- **User Login/Logout**: Securely create an account to manage your health documents, with all data tied to your personal user ID.
- **Contact Us**: Submit feedback, report issues, or request support directly from within the app.
- **About Us**: A dedicated page that explains MedMemo‚Äôs mission, core features, and how it helps users manage their medical information, including AI-powered summarization, document upload, and health resources.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.
