# MedMemo

## üìå Project Overview

MedMemo is a web application designed to help patients keep structured and informative notes from their healthcare provider visits. By simply copying and pasting a transcript of their visit dialogue, users can generate a well-organized summary that includes key medical information, personal questions, and additional context that is often missing from traditional healthcare records.

Powered by a **deep learning model** and a **large language model (LLM)**, MedMemo transforms unstructured conversation transcripts into clear, actionable medical notes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Transcript Processing**: Paste your healthcare visit dialogue, and MedMemo will analyze and structure it.
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Generates a concise yet comprehensive summary of your visit.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Input Your Transcript**: Copy and paste the dialogue from your healthcare visit into MedMemo‚Äôs text box.
